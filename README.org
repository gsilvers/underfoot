* Underfoot

Welcome to the underfoot project. This is home of a future game written in Love2D dedicated to my wonderful pupper:

* Underlying Technologies

This is a little TBD but I intend to use this project as a way to learn and enjoy some simpler tools. Work me does a ton using AWS and modern web frameworks and a change would be refreshing.

** LUA
[[https://www.lua.org][Link]] is a simple langauge designed for embedding. 

** Love2D
[[https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page][Link]] is a simplified game engine tool for use in LUA.

** Fennel
[[https://fennel-lang.org][Link]] is a lisp that compiles into LUA. I have been hankering to use a lisp or lisp like at work with little avail. I get to play with emacs for my day to day needs but I want to ship something with a lisp and here's my outlet.

* Contributing ETC

I'm planning to release this game fully open source including the assets. I hope to find some free resources to start since I am not exactly an artist. While it's mostly for me to learn if folks want to open PR's that's awesome too. For now I'll review and merge PR's as I see fit. License for this repo is TBD but it will be GPL'd of some sort.
