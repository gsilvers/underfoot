* Modules and organization

So imports seem pretty simple. Files must return a thing. And then you asign an object = require('thefilewithoutextension').  If things are in directories its the same as their file path IE require('path/to/myfile').

Its having us move our world to a world.lua


* Collision Callbacks

The next idea is how two entities in the game interact with one another. The example I guess is showing that there are four handler functions called whenever two entities collide.

It does not seem like entities can cross over, at least as i understand them yet. It does seem trivial to use begin and end contact handlers to do things like total up a score or play a sound.
